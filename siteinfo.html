                    This is a website for me to share my music hobby!
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    Each year I have the goal of listening to at least 100 new albums. 
                    At the end of the year I make lists of my favorite albums and songs I listened to, and this website is the place for me to share those lists with others!
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    On the main page select the year you want, and then choose between the two lists:
                    <ul class="bot-half-pad">
                        <li>Favorite Albums</li>
                        <li>Favorite Songs</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    This site is centered around albums, so that is the list I focus on more.
                    The "Favorite Songs" list is to let me recommend songs I like, even if I didn't like the album it was from.
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    If you are looking for certain genres of music, prefer listening to whole albums, or want to browse album art, I would suggest using the albums list.
                    Otherwise, you can use the "Favorite Songs" to get a quicker sample of each year's music.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h1 id="rating-system">Rating system</h1>
                <hr>
                <div class="mock-p top-one-half-pad">
                    There are two components to how I organize/rate the music on my lists:
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    <u>First</u>, each list is <b>in order</b> from favorite to least favorite, with the first album/song being my favorite.
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    <u>Second</u>, I organize albums into different <i>"tiers."</i>
                    I think there is a noteworthy difference between the albums in different tiers.
                    I use colors to indicate these tiers, which is why you will see some albums colored as <span class="gold">gold</span>, <span class="silver">silver</span>, and <span class="bronze">bronze</span>.
                    <!-- As you would expect, gold is the best, then silver, then bronze. -->
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p bot-one-half-pad">
                    The tiers roughly correlate to:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="gold">Gold</span> = Best albums of the year.</li>
                        <li><span class="silver">Silver</span> = Great albums that are strong highlights of the year.</li>
                        <li><span class="bronze">Bronze</span> = Good albums that are notable releases of the year.</li>
                        <li><span class="hon-men">Uncolored</span> = Honorable mentions that I wanted to include.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    One thing to note is that I listen to a lot more albums than are shown on these lists.
                    So, every album listed here is something I actually really like, even if it appears "low" on my list.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h1 id="web-dev">Development & updates</h1>
                <hr>
                <div class="mock-p top-one-half-pad">
                    This is purely a personal passion project, so things won't be too fancy and updates will be infrequent.
                    With that said, feedback/suggestions are always accepted and appreciated if there is anything you would like to see added or changed!
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    I plan on updating this with new music every few months or so.
                    This is primarily meant to share my year-end lists, rather than be constantly updated every time I listen to something new.
                    So, there will be more updates towards the end of the year as I am making my big final year-end lists.

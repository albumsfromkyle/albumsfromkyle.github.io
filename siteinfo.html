                    This is a website for me to share my music hobby!
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    Each year I have the goal of listening to at least 100 new albums. 
                    At the end of the year I make lists of my favorite albums and songs I listened to, and this website is the place for me to share those lists with others!
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    On the main page select the year you want, and then choose the list you want to see:
                    <ul class="bot-half-pad">
                        <li>Favorite Albums</li>
                        <li>Favorite Songs</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    The "Favorite Songs" list lets me recommend songs I liked, even if I didn't like the albums it was from.
                    So, it will have more variety on it.
                    But there is <b>a lot</b> of overlap between these two lists, because my favorite albums normally have my favorite songs on them.
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    So if you are looking for certain genre(s) of music, or just prefer albums, I would suggest using the albums list.
                    Otherwise, I would suggest listening to the "Favorite Songs" playlist to get a good taste of the music I recommend. 
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">

                <div class="mock-p top-one-half-pad">
                    There are two components to how I organize/rate the music on my lists:
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    <u>First</u>, each list is <b>in order</b> from favorite to least favorite, with the first album/song being my favorite.
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    <u>Second</u>, I use an olympic-like rating system to indicate different "tiers" of albums, meaning I think there is a noteworthy difference in gold albums vs. silver vs. bronze.
                    This is why you will see certain albums highlighted in <span class="gold">gold</span>, <span class="silver">silver</span>, and <span class="bronze">bronze</span>.
                    As you would expect, gold is the best, then silver, then bronze.
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p bot-one-half-pad">
                    In general, the tiers roughly correlate to:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="gold">Gold</span>      =  Extremely good albums that are the best of the year.</li>
                        <li><span class="silver">Silver</span>  =  Great albums that are strong highlights of the year.</li>
                        <li><span class="bronze">Bronze</span>  =  Very good albums that are notable releases of the year.</li>
                        <li><span class="hon-men">Uncolored</span>  =  Good albums I still wanted to include, even if they didn't receive a coloring.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="mock-p">
                    One thing to note is that I listen to a lot more albums than are shown on the lists.
                    However, I only include the albums I really enjoyed and would actually recommend to people.
                </div>
            </div>

                    This is purely a personal passion project, so it definitely won't be fancy and updates will be infrequent (besides adding new music).
                    With that said, feedback/suggestions are always accepted and appreciated if there is anything you would like to see added or changed!
                </div>
                <div id="mock-p">
                    I plan on updating this with new music every few months or so.
                    This is primarily meant to share my year-end lists, rather than be constantly updated every time I listen to something new.
                    So there will be more updates towards the end of the year, as I am making my big final changes to the lists.

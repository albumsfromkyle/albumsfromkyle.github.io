            <h1>What is this site?</h1>
            This is a website for me to share my music hobby!
            <br><br>

            Each year I have the goal of listening to at least 100 new albums. This website is a place for me to share what I find with others!
            <br><br>

            Right now, this just includes two main lists:
            <ul>
                <li>* Favorite Albums</li>
                <li>* Favorite Songs</li>
            </ul>
            Each of these lists show exactly what you would expect: my list of favorite albums from that year, and my list of favorite individual songs from that year, respectively.
            <br><br>

            If you are looking for new music, you can use either one of the lists depending on your personal preferences.
            The songs list is probably much easier to listen to, since I have an organized spotify playlist for it already.
            (I don't have one for the albums since that would require a lot of work to maintain that I don't want to do.)
            There is a decent amount of crossover between those two lists (after all, my favorite albums of the year are my favorite for a reason),
            so which ever one you choose will get you a good idea of the music I thought was best each year.
            <br><br>

            I started this hobby back in 2019, but the rules I set for myself have changed a lot throughout the years.
            Some years I listened to a lot more music than others, and some years I took long breaks from this hobby.
            So, some years may look very different than others or may appear to have many few albums than others.
            I'm sure I missed a lot of great albums as well, so you are more than welcome to recommend me anything I missed!
            <br><br>


            <h1>Rating System</h1>
            I rate on a 1-10 scale.
            <br><br>

            Some of the important cutoffs I use are below:
            <ul>
                <li>5    =  Average. Anything above this I enjoyed listening to and would relisten to. Anything below this I did not enjoy.</li>
                <li>6.5  =  Good. Anything at or above this rating I would recommend listening to.</li>
                <li>7    =  Very good. These are colored in bronze.</li>
                <li>8    =  Great. These are colored in silver.</li>
                <li>9+   =  Best of the year. These are colored in gold.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>

            One thing to note is that there will likely not be many albums with lower scores.
            Ultimately this is a hobby I do for fun, so I do not force myself to listen to albums if I think they are terrible after a first listen through.
            As a result my scores tend to skew higher on average.
            <br><br>

            <h1>Development Context</h1>
            This is purely a personal passion project. However, even though I have a great passion for music, I am not much of a fan of web development.
            Let that set the expectations for this project as a whole. It definitely won't be fancy and updates will be infrequent.
            This is NOT meant to be professional at all. I am putting up with web development so I can achieve my greater goal of sharing music with others.
            <br><br>

            Additionally, for the time being this website will ONLY be for desktop (and will only be tested using Google Chrome on my personal computer with the monitors I have at home).
            I have no idea how this will function on other sized monitors, other web browsers, or how it will look on iOS.
            Given my skills with web development, my hopes are not high.This is something that may potentially come in the future, but that is a long ways away.
            <br><br>

            For now, please be patient as I slowly develop this and add the base functionality.

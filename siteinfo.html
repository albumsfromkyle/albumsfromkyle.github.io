                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    Each year I have the goal of listening to at least 100 new albums. 
                    At the end of the year, I make lists of my favorite albums of the year and this website is the place for me to share those lists with others!
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    I started this hobby back in 2019, but the rules and goals I set for myself have changed <b>a lot</b> throughout the years.
                    So, the lists some years may look very different than others, or may have many fewer albums listed.
                    I'm sure I missed a lot of great albums as well, so you are more than welcome to recommend me anything I missed!
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    Right now, I just have two main lists for each year:
                    <ul class="bot-half-pad">
                        <li>Favorite Albums</li>
                        <li>Favorite Songs</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each of these lists show exactly what you would expect: my list of favorite albums from that year, and my list of favorite individual songs from that year.
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    If you are looking for new music, there are Spotify playlists for each of these lists for every year.
                    If you want to listen to one of them, I would highly suggest listening to the songs playlist over the albums playlist.
                    The songs playlist is generally shorter, and since there is often a lot of overlap between my favorite songs and favorite albums, 
                    it will also give you a taste of my favorite albums from that year as well.
                </div class="mock-p">

            <div class="section">
                <h1 id="rating-system">Rating system</h1>
                <hr>
                <div class="mock-p top-one-half-pad">
                    Rather than using numerical ratings, I use an olympic-like rating system.
                    You'll see this when you look at the album lists for any year and see albums highlighted in <span class="gold">gold</span>, <span class="silver">silver</span>, and <span class="bronze">bronze</span>.
                    As you would expect, <span class="gold">gold</span> is the best, then <span class="silver">silver</span>, then <span class="bronze">bronze</span>. I also include other <span class="hon-men">honorable mentions</span>, that are still good
                    albums but didn't get a coloring.
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p bot-one-half-pad">
                    In general, the colors of the albums have the following meanings:
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="gold">Gold</span>      =  Extremely good albums that (I think) are the best of the year. Roughly correlates to a <span class="nowrap">9 - 10</span> out of 10.</li>
                        <li><span class="silver">Silver</span>  =  Great albums that are strong highlights of the year. Roughly correlates to an <span class="nowrap">8 - 8.5</span> out of 10.</li>
                        <li><span class="bronze">Bronze</span>  =  Very good albums that are notable releases of the year. Roughly correlates to a <span class="nowrap">7 - 7.5</span> out of 10.</li>
                        <li><span class="hon-men">White</span>  =  Good albums that are still worth mentioning, even if they did receive a coloring. Roughly correlates to a <span class="nowarp">6 - 6.5</span> out of 10.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div class="mock-p">

                    Other notes about my rating process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Things are <i>roughly</i> in the right spot, but my exact ordering could change on a day-by-day basis, so don't take it as absolute.
                            However, I do feel generally confident in my category of each album (<span class="gold">gold</span>, <span class="silver">silver</span>, or <span class="bronze">bronze</span>).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I've experimented with giving ratings instead of using my coloring system, but I have found I prefer the more informal coloring
                            system over giving things ratings. Maybe I will change my mind on this in the future, but for now this is what I like doing.         
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I do not include the many albums that score below an "<span class="hon-men">honorable mention</span>." 
                            I want these lists to be a place to share music I think is worth highlighting and sharing, so I prefer to focus on the releases that I liked the most.
                            (If you are really dying to see <i>every</i> album I listened to and their rough rating out of 10, 
                            my lists for each year can be found in the github repo under the `csv/` directory.)

                    This is purely a personal passion project. However, even though I have a great passion for music, I am not much of a fan of web development.
                    Let that set the expectations for this project as a whole. It definitely won't be fancy and updates will be infrequent (besides adding new music).
                    This is <b>not</b> meant to be professional at all, I am using pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript and purposely using as few tools/libraries as possible.
                    I am putting up with web development so I can achieve my greater goal of sharing music with others.
                    Even with that said, feedback/suggestions are always accepted and appreciated if there is anything you would like to see added or changed!

                    This website was developed on my personal setup with my personal monitors.
                    While I did try to test the layout on different devices, I was not extremely rigorous. 
                    It <i>should</i> look fine on most other browsers, monitor sizes, and devices (yes, this website is phone-friendly as well). 
                    Although with my lack of experience in web development, I'm sure there are many situations I forgot to test. 
                    If you find a situation where things look terrible, let me know and I can try to fix it.

                    As for music updates, I plan on updating this with my listened-to music every few months or so.
                    Leading up to the end of the year in particular is when updates may be more frequent, as I am finalizing my end-of-year lists then.
                    Otherwise, it will just be updated whenever I have enough to share, and whenever I have time.

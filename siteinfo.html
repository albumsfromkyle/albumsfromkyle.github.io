                <div class="mock-p">
                    Each year I have the goal of listening to at least 100 new albums. This website is a place for me to share what I find with others!
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    I started this hobby back in 2019, but the rules I set for myself have changed a lot throughout the years.
                    Some years I listened to a lot more music than others, and some years I took long breaks from this hobby.
                    So, some years may look very different than others or may appear to have many few albums than others.
                    I'm sure I missed a lot of great albums as well, so you are more than welcome to recommend me anything I missed!
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    Right now, I just have two main lists for each year:
                    <ul class="bot-half-pad">
                        <li>Favorite Albums</li>
                        <li>Favorite Songs</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each of these lists show exactly what you would expect: my list of favorite albums from that year, and my list of favorite individual songs from that year.
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    If you are looking for new music, there are Spotify playlists for each of these lists for every year.
                    If you want to listen to one of them, I would highly suggest listening to the songs playlist over the albums playlist.
                    There is often a lot of overlap between my favorite songs and favorite albums.
                    So, the songs playlist will give you a small taste of my favorite releases that year, and it is <b>much</b> shorter than the albums playlist.
                </div class="mock-p">

                    My ratings are very informal and it is not something I put a ton of thought into, so don't take them <i>too</i> seriously.
                    Everything on here is <i>roughly</i> in the right order, which is what I care about far more than the number ratings themselves.
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">As for how I got about rating albums, I rate on a 1-10 scale.</div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p bot-one-half-pad">
                    Some of the important cutoffs I use are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>5    =  Average. Anything above this I enjoyed listening to and would relisten to. Anything below this I did not enjoy.</li>
                        <li>6.5  =  Good. Anything at or above this rating I would recommend listening to.</li>
                        <li>7    =  Very good. These are colored in bronze.</li>
                        <li>8    =  Great. These are colored in silver.</li>
                        <li>9+   =  Best of the year. These are colored in gold.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div class="mock-p">
                <div class="mock-p">
                    A few notes about my rating process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A "10" is not "one of the best albums of all time," so don't go comparing them to the all-time greats.
                            If I rated albums like that, then I would almost never give out 10s, which isn't very fun.
                            I want to be able to give out 10s, so to me a 10 is just a "really really really good album."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            There will not be many albums with really low scores (< 3). 
                            Ultimately this is a hobby I do for fun. So if I come across an album that is terrible, then I likely won't listen to it enough times to warrant rating it. 
                            It's not fun to listen to terrible albums, and it's not fun to give out really low scores.
                            I would rather spend my time going through the <b>many</b> good albums released each year instead.
                            As a result, my scores tend to skew higher on average (especially for older years where I listened to fewer albums overall).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            My goals for this hobby have changed <b>a lot</b> over the years, and so has my rating system.
                            My approach to this hobby became more concrete in 2022, so everything from there on out is relatively accurate and consistent.
                            But for years before 2022, I was not "rating" albums, I was only keeping track of my favorites.
                            I have retroactively gone back and given those albums ratings, but there will be no albums with scores below 7 for those years as a result.
                        </li>

                    This is purely a personal passion project. However, even though I have a great passion for music, I am not much of a fan of web development.
                    Let that set the expectations for this project as a whole. It definitely won't be fancy and updates will be infrequent (besides adding new music).
                    This is <b>not</b> meant to be professional at all, I am using pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript and purposely using as few tools/libraries as possible.
                    I am putting up with web development so I can achieve my greater goal of sharing music with others.

                    Additionally, for the time being this website will ONLY be for developed for the desktop experience (and will only be tested using Google Chrome on my personal computer with the monitors I have at home).
                    I have no idea how this will function on other sized monitors or how it will look on iOS.
                    Given my skills with web development, my hopes are not high. An iOS-friendly version is something that <i>might</i> come in the future, but there are no guarantees.

                    For music updates, I plan on updating this with my listened-to music every month or so.
                    Leading up to the end of the year in particular is when updates may be more frequent, as I am finalizing my end-of-year lists then.
                    For website developmental updates, those will be few and far between after this website has been deployed.
                    I plan the keep the number of features simple, and all the main features I had in mind are already finished by now.
                    I keep a todo list in the git repository if you are dying to see my ideas. Otherwise, I am always open to feedback and suggestions!

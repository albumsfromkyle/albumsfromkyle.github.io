# BEFORE RELEASE
* Update 2024 lists
* Update 2024 albums spotify playlist

* Update github readme


# GENERAL
* Add a suggestion box
* Allow the user to search things (album, artist, genre) (maybe have a bit list for the genres, so the user can see what labels there are. then have a traditional search for the album and artist)
* Maybe add "Grid Layout" in addition to "Table Layout," which will be a grid of album arts with the artist, album name, genre, and ranking beneath
* Maybe add calendar showing when I listen to certain albums
* Add ability to zoom in/out (increase/decrease the table size)???
* Stop table flickering when loading in (maybe cache the table somehow??)

# BEFORE RELEASE
* Update 2024 lists
* Update 2024 albums spotify playlist


# GENERAL
* Add a suggestion box (for music and website improvements)
* Allow the user to search things (album, artist, genre) (maybe have a big list for the genres, so the user can see what genres there even are, and then have a traditional search for the album and artist??)

# A/B
* Artist first or album?
* Dark navbar ok?
* Bolding of selected list ok?
* Order of spotify playlists in resources page?



# Feedback TODOs:
+ Make info pages shorter
+ Specify that things are ordered in favorite to least favorite in info pages, and what the colors mean
- Search function
+ Remove github logo
+ Make icons on phone?
- Maybe bolder text or bolder lines for table?
- Maybe break up grid/table into section ("gold", "silver", "bronze")
- Grid as default view!

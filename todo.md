# BEFORE RELEASE
* Update 2024 lists
* Update 2024 albums spotify playlist

* Remove all images NOT 300x300

# GENERAL
* Add a suggestion box (for music and website improvements)
* Allow the user to search things (album, artist, genre) (maybe have a big list for the genres, so the user can see what genres there even are, and then have a traditional search for the album and artist??)

# A/B
* Artist first or album?
* Dark navbar ok?
* Bolding of selected list ok?
* Order of spotify playlists in resources page?



# Feedback TODOs:
+ Make info pages shorter
+ Specify that things are ordered in favorite to least favorite in info pages, and what the colors mean
- Search function
+ Remove github logo
+ Make icons on phone?
+ Maybe bolder text or bolder lines for table?
- Maybe break up grid/table into section ("gold", "silver", "bronze")
+ Grid as default view!


# SEARCH
* How to search albums and songs at the same time?
    - Albums can be in grid, songs cannot
    - Albums and songs have different table headers
    - Maybe just allow for EITHER albums or songs to be searched, but not both
* Easy option would be just to search the page, but that's not very useful
* Other option would be to just have the drop down menu that displays the results
    - Clicking a result would bring you to that year/list
    - Not great in the case where someone wants to just search by genre, or search by artist, etc. rather than finding one specific album/song
* Should I just remove the songs list entirely?
    - Doesn't look very good unless I add grid view
    - Maybe just display the albums list, but give TWO spotify playlist links: one to albums, one to songs


# SEARCH DESIGN DECISIONS
* If you search in an albums list, it will search the albums grids (only album name, artist name, genre)
* If you search in a songs list, it will search the favorite songs tables

# SEARCH TODO
- Make search work for albums (only album name, artist name, genre)
- Allow search results to toggle between list and grid view
- Add extra info to the search results (year, favorite songs)

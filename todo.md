# GENERAL
* Fix search for albums table not always being in chronological order (only for the table, not the grid search)
* Remove images that are not actually displayed on website
    - Was originally debating to show ALL albums or just the ones I recommend, which led to me downloading ALL album art
    - Now feel confident in decision to only show recommended albums, so can free up space by removing unused images
* Remove hidden rankings - instead just go by file order
* Remove all 1-10 rankings, replace with custom
* Split main JS file into smaller files

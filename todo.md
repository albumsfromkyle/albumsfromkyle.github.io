# BEFORE RELEASE
* Update 2024 lists
* Update 2024 albums spotify playlist


# GENERAL
* Add phone-friendly layout
* Maybe add "Grid Layout" in addition to "Table Layout," which will be a grid of album arts with the artist, album name, genre, and favorite songs underneath
* Add a suggestion box (for music and website improvements)
* Allow the user to search things (album, artist, genre) (maybe have a big list for the genres, so the user can see what genres there even are, and then have a traditional search for the album and artist??)
* Stop table flickering when loading in (maybe cache the table somehow??)

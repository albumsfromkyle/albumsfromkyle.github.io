# DESIGN THOUGHTS
* Two paths to go down:
    1. It could all be one one "webpage" where I am just loading different CSV files each time
    2. Each year/list has it's own webpage that I redirect to

# GENERAL
* Allow the user to search for an album/artist
    - Prio: Low
    - Diff: High?
* Allow the user to search by genre
    - Prio: Low
    - Diff: Medium
* Add links to my end-of-year songs and albums playlists
    - Prio: Low
    - Diff: Low
* Clean up older album year Excel sheets
    - Prio: Extremely High
    - Diff: High
* Maybe add "Grid Layout" in addition to "Table Layout," which will be a grid of album arts with the artist, album name, genre, and ranking beneath (no favorite songs)

# NAV BAR
* Add ability to scroll through years in the year-selector bar
    - Prio: Extremely High
    - Diff: Medium?
* Either remove years without rankings, OR make those years "grayed out"
    - Prio: High
    - Diff: Medium
* Make the selected year, and selected list, stand out
    - Prio: High
    - Diff: Low

# TABLE
* Make the column sizes resizeable when clicked on by the user
    - Prio: High
    - Diff: High
* Allow the user to sort the table by the column (alphabetically, genre, date, rating)
    - Prio: Medium
    - Diff: Medium
* Adjust default table column sizes to fit better
    - Prio: High
    - Diff: Low
* Add row highlighting depending on rating
    - Prio: Extremely High
    - Diff: Low
* Add default if there is no rating (or other value)
    - Prio: Extremely High
    - Diff: Low
* Add hidden ranking value that determines the PRECISE ranking of each album (or at least the top ones)
    - Prio: High
    - Diff: Low

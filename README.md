## What is this?
This is a website for me to share my music hobby! 

Each year I have a goal of listening to at least 100 new albums reased that year. I plan for this website to be the place for me to share my music discoveries with others!

The main things I want to have on this are: 
* The list of all albums I listen to each year
* My year-end lists of favorite albums
* My year-end lists of favorite songs

As I go, I may add other features, but I won't make any promises for now.

## Development context
This is purely a personal passion project. However, even though I have a great passion for music, I am not much of a fan of web development. Let that set the expectations for this project as a whole. It definitely won't be fancy and updates will be infrequent. This is NOT meant to be professional at all. I am putting up with web development so I can achieve my greater goal of sharing music with others.

Additionally, for the time being this website will ONLY be for desktop (and will only be tested using Google Chrome on my monitors I have at home). I have no idea how this will function on other sized monitors, other web browsers like Firefox, or how it will look on IOS. Given my skills with web development, my hope is not high. This is something that may potentially come in the future, but that is a *long* ways away.

For now, please be patient as I slowly develop this and add the base functionality. 

## Final note
Finally, I am always open to suggestions, feedback, or comments of any kind (and any music recommendations you have ðŸ˜„).
